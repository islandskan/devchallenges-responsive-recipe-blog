                        cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker
                        crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the
                        best results, bake in a water bath.

                        Instructions
                    </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="mb-9">
                            Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position
                            and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-9">
                            <span class="font-bold">Make the crust:</span> Using
                            a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into
                            crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
                            and melted butter until combined. (You can also
                            pulse it all together in the food processor.)
                            Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom
                            and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch
                            springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I
                            use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
                            down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from
                            the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of
                            aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for
                            the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly
                            cool as you prepare the filling.
                        </li>

                            <span class="font-bold">Make the filling:</span>
                            Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle
                            attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated
                            sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                            until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2
                            minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and
                            lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On
                            medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
                            after each addition until just blended. After the
                            final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                            mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from
                            deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
                            over-mixing the batter as best you can.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-9">
                            <span class="font-bold"
                                >Prepare the simple water bath (see note):</span
                            >
                            Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in
                            your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure
                            you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
                            water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum
                            foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake
                            batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or
                            spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan
                            inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the
                            hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven.
                            (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven
                            first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is
                            easier for you.)
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-9">
                            Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the
                            center is almost set. When it's done, the center of
                            the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently
                            shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven
                            door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                            the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove
                            from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake
                            completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
                            cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-9">
                            Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from
                            the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim.
                            Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for
                            serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and
                            dip into warm water between each slice.
