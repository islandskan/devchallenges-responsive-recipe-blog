<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

-   I decided to learn and try TailwindCSS for the first time.
-   I learned how to use Tailwind, as well as how to install and run Tailwind through the CLI.
-   I liked working with Tailwind much more than I first expected! I have previously only worked with CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, Material-UI, and Semantic-UI. And unfortunately I don't enjoy working with component-based libraries, since I prefer seeing what properties are being used and being able to customize themes and configurations.
-   Because of this, I liked how Tailwind worked and I'm definately going to use it in the future.
-   Next up; I'm going to learn how to implement more advanced states, pseudo-elements, and interactivities.

-   [x] User story: I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions.
-   [x] User story: I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
-   [x] User story: I can see the number of servings and baking times.
-   [x] Extras: When ingredient is checked, the text also gets checked off(line-through the text)
